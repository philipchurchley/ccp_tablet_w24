            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
               different
               beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as
               long as
               he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not
               wanting to
               admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
               energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his
               toys "a
               ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <p>This is Lucy. She is Esther's dog. Esther doesn't know how old her own dog is, which in my opinion is
               pretty weird. The estimated age is 10, but nobody knows for sure (except Lucy's real friends).</p>
            <p>Lucy used to have a boyfriend, but her boyfriend died. </p>

            <p>This is Tiny Tim. He was named after Tiny Tim from Charles Dicken's <i>Christmas Carol</i>. Tim was a
               rescue and had a hard life, so now he hates everyone except for women and me. </p>
            <P>Tim lives a simple life. He loves the house that he lives in so he is very protective over it. He
               considers everyone he doesn't know as intruders, so he will bark and bite at them. He lives a very
               hateful life</P>
